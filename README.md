# Resources

##Basic python
Here is a concise python [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/?csw=1) from google.
##Plotting
It's kinda hard to analyze data without plotting. I like [matplotlib](http://mple.m-artwork.eu/tutorial).
##Data analysis
Most data comes in the form of a data frame, like an excel table with rows and columns. Python [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe) is a great way to analyze this type of data.

##Documentation
In science, we want to explore in such a way that people can follow and pick up where we left off. Hey, that is progress!
Documenting in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is easy and makes reading easier.
